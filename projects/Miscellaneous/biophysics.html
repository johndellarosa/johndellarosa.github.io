            <h2>Probability, Statistics, and Entropy</h2>

            <h3>Multiplicity</h3>
            A generalized multiplicity formula for arranging Z types of things in M spaces is
            $$W=\frac{M!}{\prod N_{i}!}=\frac{M!}{N_{1}!*N_{2}!*...*N_{Z}!}$$
            If there are only two possible types and M total and N of type 1, then \(N_2=M-N\) and it reduces to
            $$W=\frac{M!}{N!(M-N)!}$$
            

            <h2>Introductory Thermodynamics</h2>

            <h3>Enthalpy and the Thermodynamic Definition of Entropy</h3>
            <h4> Deriving the Thermodynamic Definition of Entropy</h4>
            By the differential form of the first law of Thermodynamics, we have
            $$dU=(\frac{\partial U}{\partial S})_{V,N}dS+(\frac{\partial U}{\partial V})_{S,N}dV=TdS-p_{ext}dV$$
            *Negative sign for pressure since our dV is pointing in opposite direction of \(p_{ext}\).
            Let us define a quantity called Enthalpy, denoted by H, as follows:
            $$H\equiv U+PV$$
            Through the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_rule">product rule</a> for differentiation:
            $$dH=dU+d(PV)=dU+(pdV+Vdp+dVdp)$$
            Substituting in the total differential form of the first law from above for dU:
            $$=(TdS-pdV)+pdV+Vdp+dVdp$$
            The dVdp term goes to 0 in the limit. The pdV term from work cancels out with one of the terms from the product rule for d(PV).
            $$=TdS+Vdp$$
            If we are working in a constant temperature environment, we can let dp=0, yielding the formula
            $$dH=TdS=dq$$

            $$dS=\frac{dq_{rev}}{T}$$
            This is the so-called "Thermodynamic definition of Entropy" which holds for a reversible process at constant pressure<br>

<h4>An Aside on Legendre Transforms</h4>
    In the first law, we had
    $$dU=TdS-pdV$$
    and when we defined Enthalpy as \(H\equiv U+PV\), we ended up getting
    $$dH=TdS+Vdp$$
    By adding PV, we were able to switch the positions of the Volume and Pressure variables (along with a sign change). 
    By doing this, we can now have a quantity that is more convenient to work with when we assume different conditions (e.g. constant pressure instead of constant volume). 
    This is from which we got heat being the change in energy at a fixed volume and the change in enthalpy at fixed pressure equivalencies (set dV=0 or dP=0 in the above equations). 
<br><br>
    This is a theme that will recur for the Helmholtz and Gibbs free energies where instead we will switch temperature and entropy, as dT=0 is more feasible than dS=0. 
    These paired variables are known as "conjugate variables," and the process of switching is known as a Legendre transformation.

<h4>Irreversible Processes</h4>

            However, what about for irreversible processes? The first law still holds such that 
            $$U=q+w$$
            but
            \(q_{rev}\neq q_{irr}\) 
            and 
            \(w_{rev}\neq w_{irr}\).
            A more general statement which holds for irreversible processes is
            $$dS\geq \frac{\delta Q}{T}$$
            This is known as the Clausius Inequality, which is another way of formulating the 2nd law.<br>
            

            <h2>Biochemistry</h2>
            <h3>Acid-Base Chemistry</h3>
            <h4>Definitions of Acid and Base</h4>
            There are 3 main basic definitions of acid-base chemistry:
            <ul>
                <li>Arrhenius: increases concentration of H+ (acid) or OH- (base)</li>
                <li>Bronsted-Lowry: proton donor (acid) and proton acceptor (base)</li>
                <li>Lewis: electron pair acceptor (acid) and electron pair donor (base)</li>
            </ul>
            The Arrhenius definition has been supplanted by the Bronsted-Lowry one, as it's more general. 
            The Lewis definition is also very important and its acids and bases are also referred to as electrophiles and nucleophiles respectively. 
            For clarity, future uses of the words "acid" and "base" will refer to the Bronsted-Lowry definition; Lewis acids and bases will be referred to by their aforementioned organic chemistry terms.

            <h4>Equilibrium Constants and pKa</h4>

            To be filled later

            <h4>Amino Acids and Acid-Base Chemistry</h4>
            As amino acids have both amine and carboxylic acid groups, they can all act as both acids and bases to some extent. 
            In fact, at a neutral pH, amino acids will be predominantly Zwitterions (molecules that have both positive and negative charges); the amine group next to the alpha carbon will be protonated and the carboxylic acid group next to the alpha carbon will be deprotonated. 
            <br>
            However, a number of the proteogenic amino acids can also participate in acid-base chemistry through their sidechains. 


            <br>
            <br>

            One might ask - why do the amide groups in Asparagine and Glutamine not participate in acid-base chemistry? 
            The answer has to do with conjugated pi systems. The lone pair on the nitrogen is not "available" to grab a proton because it prefers to be in a conjugated system with the carbonyl. 
            For the same reason, in proteins, you will not see the amide backbone being charged, only the N and C termini.
