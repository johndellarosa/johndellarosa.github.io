                <h1> Protein Folding</h1>
                <h2>Thermodynamics</h2>
                <h3>Enthalpy and Entropy</h3>
                The concepts of enthalpy and entropy will be focused on in this chapter. If you are uncomfortable with them, then you should read the earlier chapters on thermodynamics. 

                <br><br>

                What is the primary driver of protein folding? It is the <b>hydrophobic effect</b>. The hydrophobic effect is where the hydrophobic parts of the protein are burried together away from water and only the hydrophilic parts of the protein are exposed. 
                When the hydrophobic parts of the protein are burried, water molecules are freed from having to form an ordered shell. This allows for more hydrogen bonding, but even moreso, an increase in entropy for the water excluded. 
                

                <h2>Structures</h2>
                <h3>Primary Structure</h3>
                The primary structure of a protein is the sequence of amino acids, connected by amide linkages between the carboxylate group of the earlier one in the sequence and the amine group of the following one. 



                <h3>Secondary Structure</h3>
                The secondary structure involves hydrogen bonding between amide backbones of residues. There are two main conformations that the protein can fold itself into to do this. 
                <ul>
                    <li>Alpha helix</li>
                    <li>Beta sheet</li>
                </ul>
                There are a few other secondary structures that occur, but they are so rare that they are not worth mentioning. 
                A single protein can have many instances of both alpha helices and beta sheets in it. 

                <h4>Ramachandran Diagram</h4>


                <h4>Alpha Helix</h4>
                The alpha helix involves the backbone carbonyl oxygen of residue i hydrogen bonding with the hydrogen attached to the nitrogen of the amide of residue i+4. 
                When viewed from above, the angle between the i'th residue, the center axis, and the i+1'th residue is approximately 100 degrees. 


                <h4>Beta sheets</h4>



                <h3>Tertiary Structure</h3>
                The tertiary structure involves further folding of the protein onto itself with various forms of interaction. 
                <ol>
                    <li>Covalent bonds (Cysteine-Cysteine disulfide bridge)</li>
                    <li>Ionic bonds</li>
                    <li>Polar bonds</li>
                    <li>Van der Waals force</li>
                </ol>


                <h3>Quartenary Structure</h3>
                Multiple tertiary structures can come together to form a quarternary structure
                <h2>Applications</h2>
                <h3>Heat capacity</h3>
                You always have certain degrees where you can input energy, such as translational and rotational degrees of freedom. Once you reach a certain temperature, thermal energy can now be taken up to disrupt interactions, such as H-bonding, increasing the heat capacity. 

                Once those molecular interactions have been broken, that is fewer ways that heat can be taken up for the protein, decreasing the heat capacity; you can't spend energy to break intermolecular forces that are already broken. Cp is still a bit higher than it was at lower temperature, however.
