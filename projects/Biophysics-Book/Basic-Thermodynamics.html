                <h2>Introductory Thermodynamics</h2>
                <h3>Laws of Thermodynamics</h3>
                <h4>First Law of Thermodynamics</h4>
    
                The first law can be formulated in different ways. A common source of confusion for students is the seemingly inconsistent formula. 
    <br><br>
                Variant 1:
                $$\Delta U=q+w$$
                Variant 2:
                $$\Delta U=q-w$$
                So why will you see both? This is due to differences between authors in how they define the quantities in the equation. 
    
                Let's start by defining q, which we will call "heat," since this is less controversial. q will be the heat added to the system. Heat flowing (positive q) into the system will increase the amount of internal energy intuitively, so a positive q will contribute to an increase in energy. 
                Heat flowing out of the system (negative q) will decrease the amount of internal energy.
    <br><br>
                Now, for defining w, which is the "work" term. Here are the two equations again with their definition
                <ol>
                    <li>\(\Delta E=q+w\), positive w here is defined as work done <b>to</b> the system and negative w is defined as work done <b>by</b> the system</li>
                    <li>\(\Delta E=q-w\), positive w here is defined as work done <b>by</b> the system and negative w is defined as work done <b>to</b> the system</li>
                </ol>
    
                Regardless of your definition of w, if work is being performed on the system, energy is being transferred to it, but if the system is expending energy to do work, then it will lose energy. 
                From here on out, the textbook will use variant 1.
                <br><br>
                Now, the terms work and heat have not been preicsely defined yet. 
                Working definitions for the terms at this point will be:
                <ul>
                    <li>Work is controlled, harnessed transfer of energy</li>
                    <li>Heat is uncontrolled transfer of energy</li>
                </ul>
    
                Work can take various forms, but the ones we will be considering will be 
                <ol>
                    <li>Expansion work or "pV work," such as a piston moving due to a pressure difference.
                    </li>
                    <li>Chemical work, which harnesses energy from chemical reactions</li>
                </ol>
    
                There is a differential form of the equation which is expressed as:
    
                $$dE=\delta q + \delta w$$
    
                The heat and work variables have \(\delta\) instead because they are <b>inexact differentials</b>. That is to say, they have path-dependent integration. 
                While the change in energy will be the same, the contribution from work vs heat depends on how the process is done. 
    
                <h4>Second Law of Thermodynamics</h4>
                The second law of thermodynamics states that total entropy is non-decreasing over time. 
                $$\Delta S_{universe}\geq 0$$
                This is sometimes put into formula by breaking down the universe into the "system" or thing of interest and the "surroundings" or everything else. 
                $$\Delta S_{sys}+\Delta S_{surr} \geq 0$$
                A common mistake that students make is interpreting it as saying that entropy cannot decrease locally. 
                This is <b>not</b> true. Entropy can very well decrease in a system, but it will be offset by a greater increase in the surroundings. 
                In fact, much of biology involves this very trade-off.
    
                <h3>Energy</h3>
                <h4>Forms of Energy</h4>
                Energy can take different forms. The two main categories are Kinetic and Potential energy. 
                As its name suggests, kinetic energy is associated with movement. Here are 3 forms which we will consider throughout the book:
                <ol>
                    <li>Translational: a molecule's movement through space</li>
                    <li>Rotational: a molecule rotating about some axis</li>
                    <li>Vibrational: bonded atoms vibrating</li>
                </ol>
                Potential energy is associated with position rather than movement. This can also take several forms, including but not limited to:
                <ol>
                    <li>Chemical bonds</li>
                    <li>Gravitational</li>
                    <li>Concentration gradients</li>
                    <li>Electrostatic interactions</li>
                    <li>Compressed spring</li>
                </ol>
                <h4>Physics Equations</h4>
                As one formulation of the First Law states, there is conservation of energy with no input or removal from the system. 
                However, energy can be converted from one form to another. Imagine a ball rolling off of a table; its gravitational potential energy gets converted into kinetic energy, sending it downward. 
                U sometimes refers to potential energy, but also internal energy in general. In this section, U will refer to <b>Potential energy</b> and E will refer to <b>Total energy</b>.
                
                <br><br>
                In this section, positive work will refer to work <b>done</b> by the system which is opposite what we had before, but it is common convention. 
    
                $$W=-\Delta U$$
    
                How is are work required and potential energy related to forces?
    
                $$W=\int F\cdot dx$$
    
                The work done is the integral of the force, F, applied over the distance. This force may be a function of the position, x. 
    
                <h4>Hooke's Law</h4>
                Hooke's law describes the restoring force in a spring. In plain English, Hooke's law states that the restoring force a spring has is proportional to the displacement from the rest length.
                $$F=-k(x-x_0)$$
                where x is the length of the spring, \(x_0\) is the rest length of the spring, k is the spring constant, and F is the force. The sign is negative as the force counteracts the stretching and applies a force in the opposite direction. 
                We can also call \(x-x_0\) to be simply x by having our coordinate system have x_0=0; longer is positive x; compressed is negative x.
    
                Using our formula for work, we can calculate the work required to stretch a spring.
                $$W=\int_0^z (-k x) \cdot dx$$
                Because the force is in the opposite direction as the dx vector, we get an additional negative sign which cancels things out. 
                $$W=\int_0^z(kx)dx$$
                $$=\frac{1}{2}kz^2$$
                The work required is \(\frac{1}{2}kz^2\) which will be converted into potential energy.
    
                <h4>Electrostatics</h4>
                Another common force is electrostatic. The electrostatic force between two point charges is described by Coulomb's Law. 
                $$F=\frac{1}{4\pi D\varepsilon_0}\frac{q_1q_2}{r^2}$$
                where F is the force, D is the dielectric constant for the medium, \(\varepsilon_0\) is the vacuum permittivity (a constant), \(q_i\) is the charge of particle i, and r is the distance between the two charged particles. 
                In this form of Coulomb's Law, a negative value for F means an attractive force and a positive F means a repulsive force. 
    
                <h4>Morse Potential</h4>
                The harmonic oscillator/Hooke's law model is treating a molecule as if it were two nuclei connected by a spring in a classical sense. The potential energy is 
                $$U=\frac{1}{2}k(r-r_e)^2$$
                where U is your potential energy of the spring, k is your spring constant, r is the distance between the atoms and \(r_e\) is the equilibrium bond distance. So this energy function looks like a parabola with a minimum at \(r=r_e\).
    <br><br>
    
                This model is pretty decent at describing behavior close to the equilibrium bond distance, but as r gets further away from \(r_e\), we need a better model. This is where the Morse potential comes in. This is an improved version which takes into account things like nuclear-nuclear repulsion from Pauli's exclusion principle and bond dissociation. When r is too small, the Morse potential jumps in potential energy quicker than with a simple Hooke's law approximation. Bonds can't stretch infinitely; bonds break if separation grows too large. The Morse potential takes this into account by having U asymptotically approach a value in the limit as r goes to infinity instead of continuing to increase quadratically. The limit as r approaches infinity is your bond dissociation energy.
    The equation for the morse potential is given by 
    $$U(r)=D_e (1-e^{-a(r-r_e)})^2$$
    where \(D_e\) is related to the dissociation energy. 
    
    
    <h4>Lennard-Jones Potential</h4>
    The Lennard-Jones potential describes Van der Waals interactions between two molecules. 
    The potential is given by
    
    $$U(r)=4\varepsilon \left[(\frac{\sigma}{r})^{12}-(\frac{\sigma}{r})^6\right]$$
