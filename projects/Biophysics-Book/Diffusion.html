                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                Since such a large part of biology takes place in some sort of solution, diffusion is an essential process and being able to properly model it can be crucial. 
                In this section, diffusion models will be presented with increasing complexity, starting with special cases of following equations.
                <br><br>
                This chapter will build off of the stochastic processes chapter before it, especially the concept of Brownian motion. 
                Some stochastic calculus will be used which is not a listed prerequesite. 


               <h2>Fick's First Law</h2>

                Fick's first law of diffusion relates the flux of molecules diffusing to the spacial gradient.

                $$\mathbf{J}=-D \nabla \phi$$
                where \(\mathbf{J}\) is the flux vector, D is the diffusion coefficient, phi is the concentration.


                <h2>Fick's Second Law</h2>

                While Fick's first law relates the flux to the concentration gradient, 
                Fick's second law relates the partial derivative with respect to time with the second partial with respect to space.

                $$\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial t}=D\nabla^2\phi$$

                Where \(\nabla^2\) is the Laplacian operator. 
                The solution is given by 

                $$\phi(x,t)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{4\pi Dt}}e^{-\frac{x^2}{4Dt}}$$

                which is a Gaussian distribution whose variance is proportional to time elapsed.

                <h2>Diffusion Equation</h2>
                But what if the diffusivity is not homogeneous? What if the diffusivity can be affected by the local concentration? For this, we need a more complex equation.
                <br><br>

                Let \(\phi(r,t)\) be the density of a specie at coordinate r and time t. 
                Let \(D(\phi,r)\) be the a coefficient that describes how captures how diffusivity changes with respect to density and time. 
                The diffusion equation is gven by:
                $$\frac{\partial \phi(r,t)}{\partial t}=\nabla \cdot [D(\phi,r)\nabla \phi(r,t)]$$

                Note that this simplifies to Fick's second law when D is constant.
                

                <h2>Fokker-Planck Equation</h2>

                What if the particle has a drift component?

                <br><br>
                
                The probability density of a particle under drift conditions can be described by a stochastic differential equation (SDE)

                Since Brownian motion has its used in biology terminology as well, we will switch to W instead of B to describe the random process phenomenon to avoid confusion. 

                Let us describe the the location of a particle by 

                $$dX_t=\mu(X_t,t)dt+\sigma(X_t,t)dW_t$$

                where \(X_t\) is the location of the particle at time t, \(\mu(X_t,t)\) is the drift felt as a function of time and space, \(\sigma(X_t,t)\) is the noise coefficient for standard Wiener process. 

                We can describe the evolution of the probability distribution for the location of the particle through solving the Fokker-Planck Equation:

                $$\frac{\partial}{\partial t}p(x,t)=-\frac{\partial}{\partial x}[\mu(x,t)p(x,t)]+\frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2}[D(x,t)p(x,t)]$$

                where \(D(X_t,t)=\frac{1}{2}\sigma^2\)

                This becomes easier when D(x,t) is a constant, which can often be an appropriate assumption. 

                If there is no drift and D is constant, then we get the dynamics
                $$dX_t=\sqrt{2D}dW_t$$
                
                which is just a stochastic differential equation for particle undergoing Brownian motion (scaled by a constant). 
                By plugging the dynamics into the Fokker-Planck equation, we get a familiar form

                $$\frac{\partial}{\partial t}p(x,t)=D\frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2}p(x,t)$$
                which is Fick's second law. 
                
                <br><br>
                Again, note that if there is no drift, this simplifies to the above Diffusion Equation.

                <h3>Exploring the Diffusivity</h3>

                So what is the diffusivity? <br>
                The Einstein relation states that 
                $$D=\mu k_B T$$
                where \(\mu\) is the "mobility." The issue of mobility kicks the can of difficulty down the road and can be itself a task to model. 
                However, in a simple case, for a small uncharged particle moving relatively "smoothly" through a medium, we can use the Stokes-Einstein equation:

                $$D=\frac{k_BT}{6\pi \nu r}$$

                where \(\nu\) is the viscosity of the solution and r is the radius of the particle.

                We observe an expected relationship that the diffusivity increases with higher temperature. We also gain the ability to relate an easily measurable macroscoping quantity, viscosity, to a more microscopic quantity, diffusivity.
